- Add :meth:`Sonyflake.next_id_async` method to the :class:`Sonyflake` class for asynchronous ID generation.
- Add new exception :class:`MachineIDCheckFailure` for explicit machine ID validation failure handling.

Miscellaneous

- Update documentation to reflect the new API.
- Improve error messages throughout the library for better clarity and debugging.
